Simple python script which allows user to chose the bitstream file to flash the FPGA with it. 

The script is written for python3.4 but might also work with python2. I will not guarantee that this will be the case in further updates.

The script needs to be run as root!

Before using the script, xc3sprog needs to be installed. You find the source code and a guide here: http://xc3sprog.sourceforge.net/
